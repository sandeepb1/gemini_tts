# Gemini TTS Streaming Examples
# 
# The Gemini TTS integration now supports streaming for faster audio playback
# with longer texts. Audio starts playing as soon as the first chunk is ready.

# Example 1: Basic streaming TTS service call
service: tts.speak
data:
  entity_id: tts.gemini_tts_gemini_tts  # Replace with your actual entity ID
  message: >
    This is a long message that will benefit from streaming. The audio will 
    start playing immediately as chunks are generated, providing a much faster 
    experience compared to waiting for the entire audio to be generated first.
